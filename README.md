# Tutorials

The purpose of this repo is to grow the Cincinnati Golang community by way of community driven, topic-based tutorials.

**Please read the [Community](https://github.com/CincyGolangMeetup/Community) repo before getting started.**

If you have topics that are not listed here, make an issue so we can add it.  Better yet, create a tutorial on that topic!

### Creating a Tutorial
1. Pick the topic that you think best fits the tutorial you want to create. 
1. Create a directory within that topic with a name that is not already created.  For consistency, please you dash separated, lowercase names. For example: `mkdir -p interfaces/my-interface-tutorial`.  Do you best to create names that will describe your tutorial, while being somewhat brief.
